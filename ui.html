            <!--p>To dowload a course just go to the course and press the button.</p>
            <button id="start-button">Start</button-->
            <p>This chrome extension was created to be able to download all videos of a course using a premium account on tutplus website.</p>
            <p>When I created this extension I thought that it would be usefull a button to download all videos of a lesson so I could copy them to my tablet latter and be able to learn even in the train where I didn't have internet connection.</p>
            <p>I hope it helps other like me that would appreciate this kind of feature. Enjoy your learning!</p>
            <p>More info and code about this and other projects made by me at: <a href="http://christianamenos.com">my personal website</a> or <a href="https://github.com/AmenoPh1x">my github page</a>.</p>
